In today's lab, through the medium of this assignment, I learnt to use the web interface of Github platform. I learnt how tocreate a new repository and then cloned it using the terminal. I learnt commands to stage the files, commit the changes and push the files through terminal. Also, I edited the .txt file in the Github web interface and pull it using the command line. I learnt how to set up ssh authentication key.
